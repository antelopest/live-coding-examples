# First non-repeating character

Write a function that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input "stress", the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase characters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial character. For example, the input "sTreSS" should return "T".

If a string contains only repeating characters, return an empty string ("");

Note: despite its name in some languages, your function should handle any Unicode codepoint:

```
"@#@@*"    --> "#"
"かか何"   --> "何"
"🐐🦊🐐" --> "🦊"
```
